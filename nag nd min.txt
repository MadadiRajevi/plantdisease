  1. Open a terminal (PowerShell or CMD). Do the following commands
  2. Start
      * If (minikube start) doesn't work type below cmnd
      *	(minikube start --driver=docker) 
      
3. Verify Minikube is running:
   * minikube status
4. Interact with Minikube
   * minikube kubectl -- get pods -A
5. Run the following to verify the installation:
   * kubectl version --client
6. Creating deployment
   * kubectl create deployment mynginx --image=nginx
   * not mandatory==> if already created then 
     kubectl set image deployment/myngnix nginx=nginx:latest
7. Verify the deployment using: Kubernetes responds by showing you a list that includes the names of your deployment groups
   * kubectl get deployments
   output: Ensure mynginx appears in the output
8. * kubectl get pods

   * kubectl describe pods
   * kubectl get services
9. Expose Deployment as a Service:
  * kubectl expose deployment mynginx --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=80
10. Scale the Deployment
  * kubectl scale deployment mynginx --replicas=4
  * kubectl get service myngnix
  * kubectl get pods
11. Access the Nginx App

  * kubectl delete deployment mynginx
  * kubectl delete service mynginx
14. Stop Minikube (Optional):
   * minikube stop
15. Delete Minikube Cluster (Optional):
    * minikube delete
